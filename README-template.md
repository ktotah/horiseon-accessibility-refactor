# Horiseon Marketing Agency - Accessibility & SEO Refactor

## Description

### Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was to ensure that Horiseon's website is not only visually appealing but also accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and better optimized for search engines. Accessibility is not just a legal requirement; it's a moral imperative to make the web inclusive for everyone. 

### Purpose:
This purpose of this project was to enhance the user experience of the Horiseon website. By implementing best practices in web development, particularly focusing on semantic HTML and efficient CSS, I aimed to create a more navigable, readable, and overall accessible website. These changes not only benefit users with disabilities but also contribute to SEO optimization.

### Problem Solving:
The original Horiseon website, while mostly functional, lacked certain accessibility features and semantic elements. This project addresses these shortcomings by refactoring the codebase to include semantic HTML tags, improving the site's structure, and enhancing accessibility features such as image alt attributes. This not only makes the site more user-friendly for people with disabilites but also aligns it with modern web standards.

### Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the significance of web accessibility and the role of semantic HTML in creating structured, accessible web content. I also refined my skills in CSS, learning to write cleaner, more efficient code. This project was a valuable exercise in balancing aesthetic design with functional improvements to create a more inclusive web environment.
